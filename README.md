# Endurance
Deep learning library for learning purpose.
For now I am only working with the version written in Python but i would like to implement a C++ version (Im planning the code) so i can work on the technical aspects of memory, speed, ecc.

Note: The implementation is only for educational purposes. The code could be optimized and make it more flexible.
I intentionally wrote the operations explicitely so i could think about what happens.
I just wanted to try to implement backpropagation after i studied it from: 1) https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/ 
2) https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767 .


Other resource that i have consulted to compare my code (First project in Python, i'm really newbie):
